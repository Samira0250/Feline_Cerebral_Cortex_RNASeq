# Feline_Cerebral_Cortex_RNASeq

ðŸ§  Feline_Cerebral_Cortex_RNASeq
This repository contains the full pipeline for analyzing RNA-seq data from the feline cerebral cortex, with a focus on:

## Differential Gene Expression (DGE) using DESeq2

## Differential Exon Usage (DEU) using DEXSeq

The analysis is performed on mapped and counted RNA-seq reads, and includes downstream steps like normalization, visualization, gene ranking for GSEA, and exon-level quantification.

The pipeline is designed to run on a high-performance computing environment (Alabama Supercomputer). Make sure the following R packages are installed:

*DESeq2*

*DEXSeq*

*pheatmap*

*RColorBrewer*

*ggplot2*

*biomaRt (optional: for cross-species gene mapping)*


ðŸ“Š Outputs
Normalized gene expression tables

## DE results with adjusted p-values and log2 fold changes

## MA plots, PCA plots, and heatmaps of variable genes

## Ranked gene list for GSEA

## Differential exon usage results from DEXSeq

ðŸ§¬ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to characterize transcriptional changes in the feline cerebral cortex, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and genotype effects (PEA15 knockout and heterozygote).
